# AzureAD-CRUD
Powershell scripts for CRUD operations to/from AzureAD. Initially developed for a technical challenge, but decided maybe they're worth keeping. Love Postman but this served as a great learning exercise.

Work in progress. Nothing contained within these files is anything novel. Simply fit a need and will retain as a baseline for future improvements. Open for suggestions!

General Rule of Thumb:

1. Obtain Token
2. Create Account
3. Retrieve Account Info
4. Update Account Info
5. Retrieve Info for verification
6. Repeat Step 3-5 as necessary
7. Delete Account Info if required.

I know that AzureAD is morphing into Entra ID. Curious how that upcoming change might alter the functionality. Solid chance the URI's are altered.
